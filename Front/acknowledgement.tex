The path toward to the 'ACGN' has been circuitous. Its completion is thanks in large part to the special people who supported, assisted and accompanied to me along the way.

I would like to thank my dear friends-the seveners, who lead me to the fields by DeathNote, DNF, Naruto and Ge Ping. Their patient listening, unconditional help, warm company and sharing helped me to move forward better.
